## Helper Libraries

* ~~NGRX-Actions - Using decorators and class symbols to reduce the boiler-plate~~ (_The author is diverting his resources to a new state management library. see [Alternatives](#alternatives)_)
* [Angular-ngrx-data](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-ngrx-data) - Manages entity in a clever black-box
* [Nrwl Extensions](https://nrwl.io/nx) - Developer toolkit to assist in Ng development, which comes with [Ngrx CLI generators](https://nrwl.io/nx/guide-setting-up-ngrx)
* [Ngrx Schematics](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/docs/schematics) - Scaffold the cookie-cutter code

## Alternatives

* [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbooks.io/ngxs/) - State management pattern + library made with Angular patterns in mind.
* [ngx-model](https://github.com/tomastrajan/ngx-model) - Manage state via a single (service-like) API (see [here for its motivation](https://blog.angularindepth.com/model-pattern-for-angular-state-management-6cb4f0bfed87#1905)).
* [angular-redux/store](https://github.com/angular-redux/store) - The cross-over of react-redux. If you have bought into the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) ecosystem, this is compatible with most existing redux midleware/tools that are not react-specific (see [here for a comparison discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/67coeo/ngrxstore_vs_angularreduxstore/)).
* [Akita](https://netbasal.gitbook.io/akita/) - If you're familiar with CQRS, this may be a good fit for you.
